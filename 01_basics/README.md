# Getting started


## Interacting with the testnet

How to get started with Optimism's testnet, Optimism Goerli.

### Test ETH

- Go to [our faucet](https://optimismfaucet.xyz/).
   You need to follow five people or projects on github.

- Alternatively, use [the Paradigm faucet](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/) if you prefer Twitter anti-sybil.

### Endpoint

- See [our docs](https://community.optimism.io/docs/useful-tools/networks/).


### Deploying a contract

See [`1-deploy.sh`](./1-deploy.sh).
This contract is a test ERC-20 token, which includes a faucet.


### Interacting with a contract.

See [`2-faucet.sh`](./2-faucet.sh).


### I don't use Foundry

Our tutorial tells you how to use [Hardhat](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial/tree/main/getting-started#hardhat), [Remix](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial/tree/main/getting-started#remix), etc.
